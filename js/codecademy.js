console.log("Hello, world!");

// Using the let keyword, declare a variable named sale. Assign the value true to it.

let sale = true;

// Now create an if statement. Provide the if statement a condition of sale. Inside the code block of the if statement, console.log() the string 'Time to buy!'.

if(sale) {
    console.log("Time to buy!")
}

// Notice that the code inside the if statement ran, since 'Time to buy!' was logged to the console.

// Below the sale variable declaration, but before the if statement, reassign sale to false. Run your code and observe what happens, weâ€™ll be changing this behavior in the next exercise.
let sale = false;
